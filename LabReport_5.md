- The Bug is an Index out of Bounds Error that concerns the while loop having an || (or) inseatd of an && (And), because of this, it only needs one of the conditions to be true to continue adding to a size that another list might be exceeding its size.
### Step 4: Setup
- The file & directory structure needed

- The contents of each file before fixing the bug

- The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
**I just ran the bash file to compile and run the program : bash test.sh**
- A description of what to edit to fix the bug
**Well considering I purposely made it buggy, all that needs to be changed is the while loop condition: Change the || to &&, and chnage every condition with a <= sign to just < sign**


### Part 2 : 
##### I suppose the biggest takeaway I've learned from this class is to ask questions and work together, I feel like often times cs feels like an individualist challenge when it really shouldn't be, people should work together just obviously not cheat or plagiarize. But nonetheless, I feel like I learned a lot of useful techniques and shortcuts through bash scripts. Lastly, although I will probably never use in my life again, vim was pretty unique and a fun text editor to play around with.
