# Screenshot 1 - 3 : (cd commmand) Change Directory 
![Image](ScreenShot_1.png)
* ## The working directory is home
* ## The output is empty because I didn't specify where to change the directory to
* ## Not an error

![Image](ScreenShot_2.png)
* ## The working directory is lecture 1
* ## The output demonstrates that it is now inside the lecture 1 directory; able to access its content
* ## Not an error

![Image](ScreenShot_3.png)
* ## The working directory is messages
* ## The first output shows entering the messages directory to then not being able to access the english to russian translation file
* ## I suppose this would be an error in the sense that you cannot change your directory to a file, so a mismatch.

# Screenshot 4 - 6 : (ls commmand) listing
![Image](ScreenShot_4.png)
* ## Considering we are only listing what is in each directory, the working directory would be the current of which we are listing; so it would be the default start directory, home
* ## The output lists the main directory becuase without specifing a location or path, it will simply just list the first document or directory
* ## Not an error

![Image](ScreenShot_5.png)
* ## The working directory is lecture 1
* ## the output demonstrates the listing of lecture 1's content that is accessible
* ## Not an error

![Image](ScreenShot_6.png)
* ## No current directory as it finds no such file or directory; errors
* ## The output shows that we cannot directly try to access the messages directory 
* ## Errors because we must first navigate to messages with a path or cd command

# Screenshot 7 - 9 : (cat commmand) Concatenation
![Image](ScreenShot_7.png)
* ## The working directory would be home
* ## The output exhibits a need of user input to print the contents of a file or just text
* ## Not an error

![Image](ScreenShot_8.png)
* ## We are still in the home directory because cat is simply just a printer, not a directory navigator
* ## The output demonstrates another/seperate from its main use of cat that specifies what each document is specifically.
* ## Not an error

![Image](ScreenShot_9.png)
* ## Working directory remains to be home 
* ## The output shows that we cannot directly try to access the any file without properly navigating to its correlating content directory
* ## Errors, we must first use a path or some navigating command (cd) to each of the directories these files are stored in
