* ## The working directory is lecture 1
* ## The output demonstrates that it is now inside the lecture 1 directory; able to access its content
* ## Not an error

![Image](ScreenShot_3.png)
* ## The working directory is the messages that is inside of the lecture 1 folder
* ## The first output shows entering the messages directory to then not being able to access the english to russian translation file
* ## I suppose this would be an error in the sense that you cannot change your directory to a file, so a mismatch.

# Screenshot 4 - 6 : (ls commmand) listing
![Image](ScreenShot_4.png)

* ## The output lists the main directory becuase without specifing a location or path, it will simply just list the first document or directory
* ## Not an error

* ## The working directory is lecture 1
* ## the output demonstrates the listing of lecture 1's content that is accessible
