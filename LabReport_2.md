-  The method that is being called is handleRequest within the Handler Class.
-  It is through the if statements that the argument url is of relevency, as well as the fields of the Handler class are used with relvency, the string "none" is returned when the url (method argument)  has nothing to add (empty url passed), if there is a valid url message / argument being passed, then the the empty string "addtolist" gets concatenated by the split of the actual message (Input) and formated as an item to a list; returning the current string list. Of course, num (Counter) is also incremented when the message is added.
-  The only two parts that can changed is the string "addToList" per concatenation & num counter that represents the order in which the new item in the string is added.

-  The method that is being called is handleRequest again, within the Handler Class.
-  It is through the if statements that the argument url is of relevency, as well as the fields of the Handler class are used with relevancy, the string "none" is returned when the url (method argument) has nothing to add (empty url passed), if there is a valid url message / argument being passed, then the the empty string "addtolist" gets concatenated by the split of the actual message (Input) and formated as an item to a list; returning the current string list. Of course num is incremeted to 2, therefore making it the second input listed.
-  String "addToList" and num counter are changed / updated. So overall, the string list gets an item added

## Part 3 : What have I learned? (Few Sentences) 
##### The first thing I learned in week two was how to read a url and what each part meant. The second thing I learned in week 2 is how to gain access to a remote server. Lastly, the first thing I learned in week 3 was how to go about debugging code.
